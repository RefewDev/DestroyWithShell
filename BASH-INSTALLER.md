† How to install Bash on Windows 10 †

1) Open Settings.
2) Click on Update & security.
3) Click on For Developers.
4) Under "Use developer features", select the Developer mode option to setup the environment to install Bash.
5) On the message box, click Yes to turn on developer mode.
6) After the necessary components install, you'll need to restart your computer.
7) Once your computer reboots, open Control Panel.
8) Click on Programs.
9) Click on Turn Windows features on or off.
10) Check the Windows Subsystem for Linux (beta) option.
11) Click OK.
12) Once the components installed on your computer, click the Restart now button to complete the task.

After your computer restarts, you will notice that Bash will not appear in the "Recently added" list of apps, this is because Bash isn't actually installed yet. Now that you have setup the necessary components, use the following steps to complete the installation of Bash:

1) Open Start, do a search for bash.exe, and press Enter.
2) On the command prompt, type y and press Enter to download and install Bash from the Windows Store.
3) Then you'll need to create a default UNIX user account. This account doesn't have to be the same as your Windows account. Enter the username in the required field and press Enter (you can't use the username "admin").
4) Close the "bash.exe" command prompt.
